In the current scenario, no-code tools for building websites do exist but most of them are either theme-based or not affordable for common peeps. We aim to build codeless webapp builder which will be an open-source, free of cost, user-friendly web application for creating attractive websites without writing any piece of code where anyone can quickly draft components with the simple drag and drop UI. It will have the feature of drag and drop UI components, live props editing and styling, preset components and production-ready code. Not knowing how to code would no longer be a hindrance in making your own websites. It‚Äôll be a huge plus for all those individuals and businesses looking to build their sites without having to hire a professional. It even saves your time and efforts, saving you from all the unnecessary hassle to build a website!

The greatest component library in town is [Codeless](https://codeless-builder-7370finwi-aryasoni98.vercel.app), and OpenCodeless is a visual editor for it. Utilize the straightforward drag and drop UI to quickly draught components.
